Doubleclick the paintbrush, you get a target.

One: 
Target the paintbrush itself and you get a item at your feet. 
This item is an addon and can be chopped etc.

Two: 
Target an ITEM (in your backpack, on the ground etc) Not a landtile or an addon piece! 
The AddonPaintBrush changes it's own itemid, its name, and its hue to match the item you targeted.

Three: 
Target an addoncomponent (any tile in an addon or the item at your feet created earlier) 
The addoncomponent selected changes it's itemid, name and hue to match the AddonPaintBrush.

Four: 
Target an addon that has the same itemid as the AddonPaintBrush and it will raise the addon by 1 z.

In an open area add a premade addon. 
Make the addon a region of it's own. 
Create a region for each teams building area.
Set a AddonPaintBrush for team 1's region and dupe it for the number of players on that team. (Or lock it down in the region)
Do the same for each team. The AddonPaintBrush will not work outside of it's assigned region.

Remember: The paintbrush will not copy the id's of an addon so they will have to scavenge the shard for a portable version of the item they want to place in their copy!

First team to sucsessfully copy the the premade addon in their own area wins!
